# ZeroSync protocol

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zerosync/protocol.png)](https://travis-ci.org/zerosync/protocol)

## About protocol

The ZeroSync protocol is a reference implementation in C of the protocol defined in the wiki.
The implementation heavily relies on the awesome messaging framework ØMQ and it's subprojects CZMQ (high level C-API) and Zyre (peer to peer implementation).

## Interested?

Have a look at our [wiki](http://wiki.libzs.zerosync.org) for a detailed inside of libzs's use cases.

## Links of interest

* http://zeromq.org - Project page of ØMQ with all information about the project
* http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all - Super amusing guide telling you all the basics around ØMQ. Probably the best guide for an open source project I've ever read!
